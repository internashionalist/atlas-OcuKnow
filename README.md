# OcuKnow

### *OcuKnow* is an interactive educational application built with Qt and C++. It allows medical students to explore a virtual model of the human eye, including a study guide and interactive quiz mode. Designed for clarity and accessibility, OcuKnow is ideal for students studying anatomy or preparing for exams.

## File Descriptions

- `main.cpp`: Entry point of the application. Handles navigation between splash screen, quiz, and study guide.
- `UI/intro/introwidget.cpp/.h`: Main splash screen with animated background and navigation buttons.
- `UI/quiz/quiz.cpp/.h`: Logic and UI for the quiz feature.
- `UI/credits/creditswidget.cpp/.h`: Displays credits with a return option.
- `UI/eyemodel.ui`: Qt Designer file for the anatomical eye interface.
- `graphics/ocuknow_intro.gif`: Splash animation GIF.
- `graphics/half_image_eye.jpg`: Background image for the study guide.
- `resources.qrc`: Qt resource file linking embedded assets.
- `questions.txt`: Source file for quiz content.

## Usage

From the `build` folder, launch the program:

```bash
./OcuKnow
```

Upon launch, you'll see the animated splash screen with three options:

- **Enter Study Guide**
- **Take Quiz**
- **Credits**

### Study Guide

The Study Guide is a visual UI created using Qt Designer and provides an interactive model of the eye. Users can explore different anatomical parts of the eye using mouse-over or buttons. A labeled diagram helps users visualize the information.

---

### Quiz Mode

Clicking "Take Quiz" starts a multiple-choice quiz based on `questions.txt`. It includes:

- A splash screen with a Start button
- Multiple-choice questions with navigation
- A score screen and retry option

---

## Key Features

- Animated splash screen using GIFs
- Translucent and styled UI buttons
- Responsive layouts and custom fonts
- Study Guide with anatomical eye model
- Quiz feature with question parsing and scoring
- Themed styling consistent across views

## Challenges

Building OcuKnow came with its fair share of hurdles. Getting the interactive diagram of the human
eye to feel both accurate and easy to use was one of the biggest ones — it had to look good, but
also clearly teach something at a glance. Working with Qt meant learning how to juggle layouts,
signals, and event handling so the app responded smoothly when users clicked or hovered over
different parts of the diagram.

Another challenge was keeping the code organized as new pieces like the splash screen, main menu,
and interactive features were added. It was easy for things to get messy, so planning ahead and
keeping the project modular was really important. Performance also came up — making sure the
graphics and overlays ran smoothly on different systems took extra polish. And on top of the
technical side, it was always a balancing act to simplify complex biology into something clear,
engaging, and not overwhelming.
